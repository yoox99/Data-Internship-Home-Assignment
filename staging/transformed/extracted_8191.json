In the Software Engineer role, you will build new features and products, closely collaborating with our Product and Data Services teams to deliver delightful software. We have written about how our Engineering team works at engineering.stratasan.com as a resource for new and potential team members. When you think “healthcare data and analytics company,” what’s the first thought that comes to mind? That sounds like a super fun place to work. Us too! Though, maybe we’re biased?  Our bright, diverse team of analysts, engineers, product developers, and everyday dreamers are working to shake up the healthcare space and change the way hospitals use data and analytics. Serving as a hub for business development intelligence, we provide our clients with a foundation for growth in the areas of hospital planning, marketing, physician relations, and expansion.  We’re stronger because of customer-first culture and our inclusive work environment. We're a team of entrepreneurially-minded, self-motivated healthcare aficionados and technology geeks. Together, we solve complex problems, rethink conventional processes, and celebrate big wins.  We’re an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. We believe our differences truly make us stronger.  Interested in joining a team of experts? We’re looking for passionate individuals interested in challenging the status quo of healthcare data and analytics. We’re open to your fresh thinking and creative ideas. If you think we might be the right mix of innovative thinking and tech nerd to fit your professional style, then shoot us your application today!  Everybody Makes the Coffee  We help where help is needed. Whether we’re asked to pitch in to support a customer, run a meeting at the last minute, or make the morning coffee, everybody does what’s necessary to keep the engine running. We don’t believe in “pulling rank.\"  Our Success is My Success  We support one another, strive for the success of our team, and recognize that nothing is done alone.  We'll Figure it Out  We may not immediately have the answer to a question, but we’re always committed to finding one. We believe most challenges are great opportunities to consciously show up, and with a resourceful attitude, brainstorm and consider the best course of action. Whatever comes our way, we won’t quit until we find a solution.  Honest Conversations Make Us Stronger  We approach conversations from a position of vulnerability. We assume others have positive intentions and strive to see their perspective before sharing our own. This combination allows us to create stronger, more collaborative relationships—which, ultimately, is how we grow. We believe it’s important to start from the assumption that people are good and that the intent behind their actions are positive. We believe this builds stronger and more trusting relationships.",
