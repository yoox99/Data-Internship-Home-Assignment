    "description": "At Workday, we help the world’s largest organizations adapt to what’s next by bringing finance, HR, and planning into a single enterprise cloud. We work hard, and we’re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work. We are responsible for delivering tens of billions of messages annually via multiple channels (Email, SMS, Mobile Push, ..). Our team is building the next generation Communication platform to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time, to the channels that can get the most engagement value. Do you want to get into the details as needed to work directly with developers writing code and/or to spike concepts and ideas? Do you believe that mentoring is an important contribution to the long-term success of the team?  You will distill and adapt complex, nuanced technical / architectural concepts for audiences ranging from new college hires to senior management and think about the operational and security side of the software and don't simply believe that software in production is someone else's problem.
