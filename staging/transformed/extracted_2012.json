Position Description: Vulnerability researchers at Raytheon CODEX analyze systems to understand how they work and how they behave when they break. Candidates must be able to play both sides of the fence, both developing and defeating new and advanced security techniques. Projects are undertaken in small teams with close coordination with customers. All our engineers write code, but many of our engineers spend as much time taking systems apart as building new ones. A typical day can involve studying disassembly or writing Python to audit a piece of C++ code",
