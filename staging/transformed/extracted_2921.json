    "description": "Snapdocs is a rapidly growing San Francisco-based real estate technology unicorn backed by leading investors Sequoia, Y Combinator, Tiger Global, F-Prime, and others. We're on a mission to perfect mortgage closings for all. Powering millions of closings a year, Snapdocs is leading the charge to modernize, streamline, and improve the mortgage process for lenders, borrowers, and settlement.  The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.  We trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now we're looking to hire another core engineer to help us scale our platform.  As a Software Engineer you will play a central role in building a quality digital closing platform that our partners can trust and use. We build high-volume, low-latency applications for mission-critical business systems that enable our users to streamline workflows. You will design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and distributed systems. In addition to contributing to core services, you will contribute to debugging production issues across services, participate in code reviews and arch specs. Your day to day interactions span product and engineering teams to release at a high velocity in all phases of the SDLC. We have a small team so your contributions will have huge impact.  Here is where you come in. Upon completing your BS/BA Computer Science, you joined the industry ready to contribute to a growing business. Now it's time to dive into the startup world and apply your talents to solve real world problems. Over the past 4+ years you have mastered object-oriented programming with at least one of these Ruby, Go, Python, Scala, Java etc working in a production environment. More recently you have been focused on backend development, building APIs, services & working with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc). You have a bias for testing and quality is at the center of your work. Cross functional collaboration is important to you as you are eager to solve a range of problems across the org. Today our team is working in Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, AWS, Docker, & Kubernetes to name a few but things change quickly so be comfortable learning new tools. We take a pragmatic approach to programming language experience and believe languages can be learned so don't get too hung up if you have not worked with our tools. Hopefully learning new tools & new languages is something you are eager to do.  Snapdocs strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team to make smart decisions. This means we value independent work as well as collaboration. We provide excellent benefits (listed below) and are located in both San Francisco and Denver! Snapdocs is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know.  California residents applying for positions at Snapdocs are subject to our candidate privacy policy.",
