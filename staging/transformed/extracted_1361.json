    "description": "CDA is searching for an experienced software engineer to help our transition to a cloud-based IT ecosystem. We are aggressively moving from older, siloed, on-premises solutions to Azure and AWS hosted systems that integrate with each other in real time.  This position will be responsible for applying software development skills and methodology to fill gaps in our overall solution portfolio. Rather than performing extensive ground up development of systems, our efforts will center on creatively integrating disconnected systems while filling in functional gaps as needed. The primary development languages used at CDA are C#, Java, PowerShell, and bash. However, our software engineer should be comfortable with leaning on a solid understanding of core web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, XML and Json to adapt their solution approach given a variety of runtime environments and components.  The Software Engineer analyzes, designs, develops, modifies, writes, edits, and implements software programming applications. The primary responsibility of the position will be to execute on the design, development and delivery of technology that enables great customer experiences that deliver on desired functionality on behalf of the organization. This will include developing production grade code through vision, definition, planning, execution, deployment and sustainment as well as performing unit testing to ensure conformance to specifications. Occasionally (1-33%) Frequently (34-66%) Constantly (67-100%) Over our 150-year history, the California Dental Association (CDA) has become a leader in oral health throughout California and the country. Today, we continue to support our community of over 27,000 dentists through our family of companies, which include The Dentists Insurance Company (TDIC), TDIC Insurance Solutions, Rotunda Partners and the CDA Foundation.
