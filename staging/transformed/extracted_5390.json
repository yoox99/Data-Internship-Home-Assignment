We have experienced tremendous growth and have become a disruptive force in the automotive industry. Vroom is an exciting, dynamic workplace, and there's no better time to join the team than right now. This person will be expected to deliver quality code and challenge the team to do the same.

This person is always presenting new tech to the team and driving the needle forward for the team to increase code quality, code maintainability, and team productivity. This full-time role offers competitive compensation; health, dental, and vision insurance; a 401k plan; fully company-paid short term disability, long term disability, and life insurance; access to a healthcare concierge service with virtual visits; and 15 annualized days of paid vacation.  But our biggest benefit is being part of a low-ego, high performing team that's transforming the used car market into a modern, online and data-driven industry.
