    "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "industry": "Higher Education",
    "description": "Each year, 3,000,000 students drop out of higher ed for financial reasons. And 40% of low-income students who are admitted to college never enroll because they don’t know how to pay for it. These young adults need access to simple, mobile and personalized financial support. You can help us remove cost as a barrier to education.  We don’t have twirling slides into ball pits or roving massage therapists, but the culture here is paramount. We work hard to keep it healthy. You will feel supported and liberated to do your best work here. And you’ll have a life-changing impact on the lives of millions of students in a high-growth SaaS company. If that sounds refreshing, read on. We’re looking for full stack enthusiasts who are comfortable tackling end-to-end and enjoy building products that solve big problems and delight customers. We’re a collaborative team who knows how to get things done (Lone Rangers need not apply). We believe that small teams focused on shipping software move the fastest and make the most impact. The ideal candidate for this position has extensive back end skills (Ruby or Go, PostgreSQL or MongoDB, AWS is a plus) paired with solid web skills (JavaScript and/or TypeScript, CSS, React is a plus).  You bring discipline and care to implementation practices. You are familiar with Agile/Scrum processes, practice common design patterns, embrace clean coding principles, write automated tests, and employ many other techniques to bring a high level of software craftsmanship to your finished product. You see regular code reviews as opportunities to learn from and educate your talented peers, and you're excited to constructively participate. You will do a combination of pair programming and solo programming to accomplish tasks. As a senior engineer you will also conduct mentoring sessions with other engineers to help them improve their own technical skills.  We iterate quickly with an emphasis on lean development, you will see your work have an immediate, scaled impact every day. You will create, maintain, and optimize source code for large web service and web applications using the above technologies. You will also be called upon to help design and build new product for an aggressive growth driven roadmap. In 2011, we set out to help schools change lives by removing barriers from Student Financial Success. By making financial aid easy, mobile, and personalized, more students can access aid—and the education it pays for, make better decisions that reduce borrowing, and easily navigate financial aid with less staff burden and cost. Today, CampusLogic transforms the way more than 500 colleges and universities deliver financial aid with the first and only student finance platform.
