Excellent communication The Data Scientist will be responsible in assessing AI (Artificial Intelligence) solutions implemented across the bank (built internally or externally) to identify any risks which may have unintended consequences. Thereby, assisting Client to follow principles of Responsible AI (Fairness/Equality/Justice, Privacy, Transparency etc).  Critically assess and challenge models on conceptual soundness, assumptions and limitations, data, developmental evidence in support of modeling choices, performance, implementation and documentation.  Understand the core methodology in AI solutions and the context in which it will be deployed so as to find risks/gaps.  Develop efficient methodologies to detect and to quantify risks/gaps in AI solutions.  Suggest alternative approaches or controls to mitigate risks/gaps identified.  Develop and implement testing plans and testing code in order to challenge models through empirical analyses and to verify model implementation.  Create metrics to quantify risks/gaps specific to each AI solution and define thresholds after consulting with all stakeholders.  Monitor metrics for breach of thresholds.  Look for unexpected risks / unintended consequences of an AI solution over its life cycle.  Assist in evaluating AI Solutions during Tollgate, Risk Assessment & Permit-to-Operate process.  Write technical reports for distribution and presentation to model developers, senior management, and audit.
