    "description": "Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.  The Instagram Core Growth team is focused on increasing the size of the Instagram Community. We do this by communicating the value of Instagram to people who are not yet on the platform, allowing new users to easily create and access their Instagram accounts, and make sure existing users are able to connect to their friends and interests on Instagram. This work has led to Instagram having tremendous growth over the past several years and as we’ve grown, the low hanging fruit has diminished. We will need you to tackle some of the thorniest issues that the Core Growth team is faced with, and help us accelerate our user growth. We’re looking for a strong Data Scientist to help us accelerate this trajectory. This is an opportunity to join an organization that has driven the expansion of one of the largest consumer apps in the world. If you’re looking to guide our strategy for the next phase of growth, excited about wrestling with thorny data problems, and want to join a world-class team, this is the right role for you.
