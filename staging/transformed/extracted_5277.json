Our platforms are highly-performant, deployed at scale, and setting new standards for enabling effective advertising while protecting user privacy.    We are looking for an ambitious, self-starter individual who can thrive in an agile environment. You will develop distributed systems to establish, refine and automate our anti-fraud processes across our advertising surfaces. This role involves running big data analytics, and building large scale data infrastructure as well. Detecting meaningful data patterns, assuring the integrity of our data, measuring fraud activity and its impact on campaign and user performance, and finally, analyzing the results of mitigations against fraud. In addition, the successful candidate may also apply ML techniques for identifying characteristics and patterns related to fraud activity and implementing them to protect our business. 5 or more years of industry experience building scalable micro services or data driven platforms.   Strong computer science fundamentals.   Prior experience with Java/Scala/C++ or equivalent.   Expertise in NoSQL datastores ( e.g Cassandra )   Proficiency in data processing technologies (e.g Kafka, Spark, Flink)   Deep understanding in at least one of the following domains: ad fraud detection, business/ads integrity, online advertising systems.
