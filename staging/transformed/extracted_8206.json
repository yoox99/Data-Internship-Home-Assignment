With data from 2M customers nation-wide acquired over 40 years of experience, our business is ripe for a disruption where legacy manual processes can be automated, enhanced, and scaled, creating high business value. There is a wide variety of new and exciting problems to solve, many of which are unique to our industry, such as automated repair recommendations, dynamic pricing, cost modeling, predicting time to failure, repair vs replace decisions, cycle-time prediction, and more.  We are looking for someone who is a fast and independent learner, curious, and passionate about data science and machine learning. You will be working in a diverse environment where you’ll collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of data scientists, analysts, software engineers, and product managers. You’ll be encouraged to take ownership of your projects and to find new opportunities and problems where machine learning could be applied to improve the business. We are passionate about empowering our people, and are creating an environment where associates are engaged and excited to be part of taking the hassle out of home ownership. Our approach to benefits is holistic, and includes health, wellbeing and financial components including: insurance for medical/pharmacy, dental, vision, life, and disability, weight loss and smoking cessation programs, matching 401(k) and ability to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. The incoming salary for this role is $140,000 for the minimum level of experience outlined in the requirements for this role; however, the salary we ultimately offer will typically increase commensurate with experience.
