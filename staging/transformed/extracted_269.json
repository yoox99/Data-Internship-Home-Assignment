    "title": "Staff Engineer 2 - Machine Learning/Data Engineer",
    "industry": "Research,Higher Education",
    "description": "SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory seeks a machine learning engineer with a proven track record of enabling machine learning applications at scale in the sciences. SLAC is one of the world’s premier research laboratories, with internationally leading capabilities in photon science, accelerator physics, high energy physics (HEP), and energy sciences.  Machine learning is expected to play an important role in nearly every major project at SLAC. Applications include deep learning for detector analysis, online control of facilities, surrogate models for high-fidelity simulations, and new modes of data analysis to handle data rates that can reach TBs/second. Though still in its early stages in physics, ML is expected to have a transformative effect on SLAC’s science output.  The new ML initiative was founded to push the limits of SLAC’s highest impact science. The data engineer position will help ML researchers scale training to large data sets, deploy solutions to live experiments, build infrastructure to assemble data sets, and enable active control of experiments and scientific facilities. While the position does not require deep ML expertise, the candidate should be comfortable enough with ML concepts to work closely with researchers. The role is interdisciplinary and collaborative, and the candidate will work jointly with scientists at SLAC, academics at Stanford, industrial partners in Silicon Valley, and facility users from around the world. Finally, the candidate should have a creative spark to tackle unsolved problems in science",
