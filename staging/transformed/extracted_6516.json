    "industry": "Information Technology and Services",
    "description": "Role Summary  In this role, you will be working with other data scientists and engineers to help build our unstructured data extraction pipeline. You will be responsible for leveraging the latest machine learning and natural language processing technology to structure and normalize data from medical records. The ideal candidate will have no issue digging into messy data, working with clinical subject matter experts to develop annotation guidelines to produce high-quality machine learning models. As a data scientist at Ciitizen, you will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the machine learning project lifecycle from dataset curation to model deployment. Ciitizen is a health technology platform that enables patients with cancer and rare neurologic disorders to collect, digitize, and share their health information. Funded by Andreessen-Horowitz and founded by serial entrepreneur and former Head of Health at Apple (Anil Sethi), it began with the simple idea that anyone should be able to manage their own medical records, but was motivated by the harder reality of helping Anilâ€™s own sister fight her battle with cancer. Our mission is for patients to control their healthcare data so that they can control their healthcare options.  This is a remote position.",
