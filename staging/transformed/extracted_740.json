    "description": "The Company  Miso Robotics is transforming the restaurant industry and making a real impact on the world. We've developed a robotic kitchen assistant, Flippy, that can perform a variety of kitchen tasks including flipping burgers and running the deep fryer. Our product is a robotic arm on a rail that fits into existing kitchens along existing cook lines and is designed to work with existing equipment alongside kitchen workers. Under the hood, Flippy relies on our platform which combines deep learning and other computer vision technologies with optimization-based scheduling and nonlinear control to adapt quickly to a variety of kitchen workflows, while achieving graceful and efficient motion.  The challenge of bringing robotics into commercial kitchens requires many disciplines to come together. The compositions of teams at Miso Robotics reflect this multidisciplinary nature of our work. We have built a world-class team and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us. If you believe, like we do, that the future of the kitchen involves robotics and artificial intelligence (HINT: It definitely does) and if you want to count yourself among the handful of lucky people who've found themselves with the opportunity to solve this problem, then Miso Robotics might be the right place for you!  The Role  In the Site Reliability Engineer role, you will be responsible for bridging the gap between products, operations and developers through automation, tools and methodologies. You will work closely with our software engineering team to design, define, execute, monitor and manage our cloud infrastructure to meet company needs. The team is still growing, so the responsibilities will be wide and varied. The primary responsibilities of this role are automating and orchestrating builds, implementing infrastructure, and managing configuration in a cloud first environment. Additionally, the role will include maintaining on-prem and legacy devices with an emphasis on Linux servers, Virtual Machines, and Cisco Meraki switches.  What Youâ€™ll Do Necessary Skills",
