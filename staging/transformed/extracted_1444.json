    "description": "Our mission at OpenAI is to discover and enact the path to safe, beneficial AGI. To do this, we believe that many technical breakthroughs are needed in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, large scale optimization, active learning, among other topics.  The Applied AI Research team works on innovative solutions to solve practical real-world problems with direct impact on users of the OpenAI API. Powerful language models like GPT-3 excel at learning behavior patterns from the pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. Thus the quality and scale of the datasets will play a crucial role in any applications built on top of such models. We seek a Machine Learning Engineer to help design and build the pipelines to collect and manage high-quality data for various projects within Applied AI.  Candidates for this role should have good engineering skills, industry experience in Machine Learning / Data Science, knowledge of processing a large amount of data in various formats and passion for building AI products. Weâ€™re building safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and ensuring it leads to a good outcome for humans. We believe that unreasonably great results are best delivered by a highly creative group working in concert. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
