    "description": "Products and Technology What we do …  Tableau is as much a philosophy as an amazing suite of tools. We enable people to transform data into something visual and understandable, enabling people to make important decisions based on those insights. Our primary mission is to help all people see and understand the meaning behind the world’s data, covering a wealth of domains from social justice to health care to environmental issues. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you.  Tableau Public plays an important role in connecting people with relevant, high-quality data stories. This role has been more important than ever as the world struggles to understand the impact of COVID 19. Tableau has taken a position as a source of trusted data and analysis for COVID19, and Tableau Public has been the backbone of this effort. There has been a surge in Tableau adoption, as local and state governments, as well as public health institutions, are communicating important COVID19 data and statistics with their constituents using Tableau Public visualizations.  Besides helping people see and understand their data, we also have some really fun architectural and scaling challenges. Tableau Public is the largest Tableau deployment in the world and has the largest data visualization repository in a single place. In addition to supporting the busiest Tableau server in production, our team has been a front-runner at Tableau in exploring new technologies. Tableau Public was one of the first teams to transition to AWS, Kuberbetes, Docker, and React, and we continuously strive to leverage emerging products to help us improve our customer's experiences on the platform. This role will have the opportunity to be a strong technical contributor on our middle tier team, driving towards next-gen SaaS architecture and deployment strategies. We’re looking for someone well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, and is an expert in Enterprise Java, SaaS, and Containerization. It’s also important that you’re familiar with transitioning larger legacy services to modern architecture strategies, e.g. breaking up a monolith to microservices or moving an on-prem product to SaaS. Experience in engineering practices around continuous deployment would be an asset. Finally, you should love learning new things, being a mentor, and leading by example as you push for engineering excellence.
