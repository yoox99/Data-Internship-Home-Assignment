    "description": "🚀 Whatnot  Whatnot (YC W20) is a livestream shopping platform and marketplace backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator. We’re one of YC’s top companies and one of the fastest growing marketplaces ever. We’re laser focused on creating an exceptional software company, team, and place to work. You can read our principles here.  Our mission: enable anyone to turn their passion into a business and bring people together through commerce. We’re building the future of ecommerce; an interactive community where creators can make a living off their passion.  Did we mention we’re high growth? We’ve 10x’d the company in 6 months! In January, Whatnot was 10 people. Today, our team is approaching 60 and will exceed 100 by year end. We’re hiring forward thinking problem solvers across all functional areas. We recruit thoughtfully, can move fast, and are scaling fully remotely.  📈 Opportunity Size  The ecommerce experience has been static for 20+ years and is perhaps the largest opportunity in the startup space today. Livestream shopping is a $170B GMV market in China and has grown 100% YoY. Retail is a $5T market opportunity! We are looking for intellectually curious, highly motivated individuals to be foundational members of our Data Science and Machine Learning team. You will partner across the company to identify critical goals for the business, develop a deep understanding of them, and design scalable solutions. The ideal candidate will be able to navigate the data stack and support initiatives from data engineering, product analytics, exploratory data analysis to machine learning, service deployments, and monitoring.  💻 Role 👋 You 🎁 Benefits 💛  Curious about who thrives at Whatnot? We’ve found that low ego, a growth mindset, and leaning into action and high impact goes a long way here.  At Whatnot, we value diversity. We are an equal opportunity employer: we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.",
