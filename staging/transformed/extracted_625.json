    "description": "At Palo Alto Networks® everything starts and ends with our mission:  Being the cybersecurity partner of choice, protecting our digital way of life.  We have the vision of a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before. These aren’t easy goals to accomplish – but we’re not here for easy. We’re here for better. We are a company built on the foundation of challenging and disrupting the way things are done, and we’re looking for innovators who are as committed to shaping the future of cybersecurity as we are.  We’re changing the nature of work. Palo Alto Networks is evolving to meet the needs of our employees now and in the future through FLEXWORK, our approach to how we work. From benefits to learning, location to leadership, we’ve rethought and recreated every aspect of the employee experience at Palo Alto Networks. And because it FLEXes around each individual employee based on their individual choices, employees are empowered to push boundaries and help us all evolve, together. As a Palo Alto Networks Solutions Architect in our XDR space, you will be the expert for our Cortex portfolio for Enterprise Accounts. Your portfolio includes Advanced Endpoint Protection (XDR), Cortex XDR – Investigations and Response, Cortex XDR – Analytics, Autofocus, Cortex Data Lake and XSOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response).  You are the “go to” resource for customer interactions that exceed standard SE support requirements. Your role is one of technical mentorship – working with your Account Manager to build integrated solutions for our client’s unique environments. With your colleagues, you will displace competing technologies, and build market share within your targeted list of major SLED accounts, and most importantly, help your client sleep at night as our product integrates to build secure digital transactions. As part of our Systems Engineering team, you’ll support the Sales team with technical expertise and guidance when establishing trust with key clients. You won’t find someone at Palo Alto Networks who isn’t committed to your success – everyone pitches in to assist when it comes to solutions selling, learning, and development. As a member of our Systems Engineering team, you are motivated by a solutions-focused sales environment and find fulfillment in working with clients to resolve incredible complex cyberthreats. We’re trailblazers who dream big, take risks, and challenge cybersecurity’s status quo. It’s simple: We can’t accomplish our mission without diverse teams innovating, together.  We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all qualified individuals with disabilities. If you require assistance or accommodation due to a disability or special need, please contact us at accommodations@paloaltonetworks.com.  Palo Alto Networks is an equal opportunity employer.
