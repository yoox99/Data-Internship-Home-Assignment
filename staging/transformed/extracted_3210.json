    "description": "The Juice is reinventing the B2B Content Marketing landscape, putting content consumers front and center.  The Juice collects, consolidates, and curates insightful resources from across the internet into a single platform where members can organize, share, and enjoy content curated for them without ever having to fill out a form.  While much of the best educational content for professionals is produced by brands, the experience of consuming this content has traditionally been terrible, with gated content forms followed by the inevitable pummeling of unwanted sales pitches. The Juice puts content consumers in control of how and when they engage with brands, while augmenting the impact and audience for brands that produce quality content. The Juice is looking for a motivated Software Engineer. You should be an experienced software engineer who enjoys building cutting edge technology from the ground up.  As one of the first members of the engineering team in a fast growing start-up, this is an opportunity to have your fingerprints on a product and team that is creating a content marketing platform to put an end to antiquated marketing and sales tactics. Your efforts will shape the future of the company and your career growth and opportunities will be dramatically accelerated. You'll work closely with the product and engineering teams while reporting directly to our CTO.  The Juice is based in Indianapolis, but open to remote employees.",
