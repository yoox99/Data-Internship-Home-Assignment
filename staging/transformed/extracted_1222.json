    "description": "Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square. Good decision-making is only possible when you have trustworthy and reliable data, along with the right tools and systems to process, analyze, and consume that data. The Data Products Engineering team is tasked with writing and maintaining a suite of self-service data productivity and discovery applications and services integral to Square’s data ecosystem. You are an experienced software engineer, ready to bring your skills towards building (modern / next generation) data solutions.
