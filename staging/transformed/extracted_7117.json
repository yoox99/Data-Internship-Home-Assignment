    "description": "Please note: All roles at Rhino are remote, and there will be no future in-office mandate.  Our mission is to give renters everywhere greater financial freedom to plan and enjoy their lives.  Our first product eliminates cash security deposits and puts more money back in renters’ pockets. With over $45 billion tied up in security deposits for 110 million renters in the United States alone, it’s time for security deposits to officially become a thing of the past. Tying up money at one of life’s biggest and most expensive moments just isn’t fair.  So we threw out the antiquated “way of doing things” and built a technology-driven insurance product to help bring renting into the 21st century. With Rhino, millions of renters across the country now have the opportunity to save with our award-winning deposit insurance. We’ve already saved hundreds of millions of dollars for renters and are trusted in over 1 million homes nationwide, and most importantly, we’re just getting started...  As a Data Engineer at Rhino, you will build data infrastructure to enable data driven decision making for the whole company. You will be partnering with Data Science, Business Intelligence and business stakeholders to build tools, data models and pipelines to empower teams to access and use data in an effective and scalable way.  This role reports to a Data Engineering Manager. Rhino is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity for all employees, and to providing employees with a work environment free of discrimination and harassment.
