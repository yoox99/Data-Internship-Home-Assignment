    "description": "Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.  Stories is at the heart of Instagram and continues to be a main reason people love our app. People use Stories to share their day, connect with their friends, and interact with content they love. Our job on the Stories team is to ensure an exceptional product experience that supports the ability to connect while maintaining a spirit of kindness. Data Science is crucial in ensuring we do this well and so we are looking for an experienced Data Scientist to support the whole Stories Ecosystem. We are looking for an individual contributor who can work across the different areas within Stories and jump into any problem and drive clarity and cohesion. This person will be tackling highly ambiguous problems and taking on projects that are cross-functional and strategic, by nature.
