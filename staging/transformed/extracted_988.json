    "description": "NVIDIA has continuously reinvented itself over two decades. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing. NVIDIA is a “learning machine” that constantly evolves by adapting to new opportunities that are hard to tackle, that only we can pursue, and that matter to the world. This is our life’s work, to amplify human creativity and intelligence. Make the choice to join us today.  As an integral member of the FP&A Organization, our responsibilities are to leverage data to predict and forecast our revenue and expenses. In the role, you will work on a wide variety of projects. One project could be building a dashboard that tracks KPI's and making it easy to analyze them. Another project could be building a propensity to churn score for our fast growing SaaS businesses. You will be the subject matter authority on data and how to translate it to making better business decisions. NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers; we have some of the most forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working for us and, due to unparalleled growth, best-in-class teams are rapidly growing.
