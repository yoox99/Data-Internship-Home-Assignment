The Consumer Finance Science and Analytics (CFSA) team's mission is to inject advanced quantitative techniques into traditional financial analytics. We are data leaders, who identify and deliver actionable financial analyses and recommendations.  As we expand our transportation footprint, Amazon faces important questions, including how can we identify and influence controllable factors to reduce transportation costs while driving the Amazon flywheel? CFSA is partnering with the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) finance team, who is dedicated to answering these questions using statistical and machine learning methods.  Amazon is looking for the next outstanding Data Scientist to help build a brand new product that analyzes transportation costs, led by SCOT. They will partner with a team of finance specialists, economists and business intelligence engineers to build models that explain Amazonâ€™s transportation costs and decompose them into controllable and non-controllable levers.
