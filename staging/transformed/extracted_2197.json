    "description": "Wish is a mobile e-commerce platform that flips traditional shopping on its head. We connect hundreds of millions of people with the widest selection of delightful, surprising, and—most importantly—affordable products delivered directly to their doors. Each day on Wish, millions of customers in more than 160 countries around the world discover new products. For our over 1 million merchant partners, anyone with a good idea and a mobile phone can instantly tap into a global market.  We're fueled by creating unique products and experiences that give people access to a new type of commerce, where all are welcome. If you’ve been searching for a supportive environment to chase your curiosity and use data to investigate the questions that matter most to you, this is the place. The goal of the Payments Team is to provide buyers and sellers everywhere with a friction-less payments experience on our platform. In just over five years, we have built a business with a truly global reach and operations in over 70 countries. This is a great opportunity for an engineer to own high impact initiatives on a high-volume, mission critical system.  We are in charge of building and maintaining our own global payments infrastructure, at all levels of the stack. We are responsible for the payments experience end to end; from the seamless checkout flow that allows customers around the world to purchase goods in their preferred methods, to the backend APIs and payment processor integrations.  We are looking for strong full-stack and back-end software engineers to join a small and nimble team, and help define and execute Wish's strategy for global payments. The ideal candidate will combine solid engineering and product skills, and thrive in a fast-paced, iterative, and collaborative environment. You will tackle exciting technical challenges that come with scale (huge volumes of transactions, currencies, and methods to support) and have responsibility measured in billions.
