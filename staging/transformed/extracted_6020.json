    "description": "At Palo Alto Networks® everything starts and ends with our mission:  Being the cybersecurity partner of choice, protecting our digital way of life.  We have the vision of a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before. These aren’t easy goals to accomplish – but we’re not here for easy. We’re here for better. We are a company built on the foundation of challenging and disrupting the way things are done, and we’re looking for innovators who are as committed to shaping the future of cybersecurity as we are.  We’re changing the nature of work. Palo Alto Networks is evolving to meet the needs of our employees now and in the future through FLEXWORK, our approach to how we work. From benefits to learning, location to leadership, we’ve rethought and recreated every aspect of the employee experience at Palo Alto Networks. And because it FLEXes around each individual employee based on their individual choices, employees are empowered to push boundaries and help us all evolve, together. We're looking for a Senior Staff Software Engineer to join the platform team at Xpanse, the newest addition to Palo Alto Networks Cortex.  The Xpanse Internet intelligence platform surveys petabytes of data to find risks online and protect some of the world’s largest organizations from malicious actors. As an engineer on the Xpanse Data Platform team, you will familiarize yourself with the basic infrastructure of the Internet, onboard datasets, and securely integrate client data. Additionally, you will build, operate, and maintain large scale data processing and distributed systems to build a coherent view of the Internet for the Xpanse internet intelligence platform.  As a technical leader, you'll mentor team members, develop features end-to-end, and support systems in production. You'll collaborate with the rest of the team on architectural direction, technical debt, and evolving the team's agile development process. We’re trailblazers that dream big, take risks, and challenge cybersecurity’s status quo. It’s simple: we can’t accomplish our mission without diverse teams innovating, together.  We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all qualified individuals with a disability. If you require assistance or accommodation due to a disability or special need, please contact us at accommodations@paloaltonetworks.com.  Palo Alto Networks is an equal opportunity employer.
