    "description": "Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.  The Business Messaging monetization team is responsible for monetizing messaging apps (Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram Direct). Millions of small businesses have adopted our flagship product, Click to Message Ads, to build and grow their businesses via messaging their customers across the Facebook family of apps. The Click to Message Ads is one of the fastest growing ads products growing from zero to multi-billion dollars in the last few years in emerging markets. The product is expected to be a significant percentage of Facebook revenue growth in the coming years.We are looking for experienced Data Scientist to lead the monetization efforts on WhatsApp by helping us scale and optimize Click to WhatsApp ads (CTWA Ads). CTWA Ad is one of the fastest growing ad formats and is on track to be a significant revenue driver for the company. It leverages the power of Facebook and Instagram reach and WhatsApp’s core functionality of delightful and private messaging. It allows businesses to target users in Facebook, Instagram and other properties across Facebook, Inc. and enable the businesses to open WhatsApp threads and start interacting with users over WhatsApp. For example: A business which sells apparel, uses CTWA ads to open threads with customers where they sell the product, provide discount and accept payments from customers. The product (CTWA ads) is being used by millions of small businesses (many without websites) to support and scale their businesses, particularly important during the current pandemic. The product is in a sweet spot, where it has already proven strong product market fit and generating meaningful revenue. But it’s also in the early stage, so plenty of scope to make foundational impact. Facebook is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
