    "description": "The mission of Microsoft Digital is to power, protect, and transform Microsoft as the voice of our digital transition in the market.  As part of Microsoft’s Cloud + AI Group, we are responsible for building, managing, and securing the platform, products, processes, and services that powers Microsoft. We build, maintain, and implement a cloud-first approach to our technology and experiences, from custom-built business solutions developing our campus of the future and our productivity and collaboration experiences like Teams and SharePoint, to horizontal 3rd party solutions like SAP and Adobe. As a steward of Microsoft and our customer’s data, a core function of Microsoft Digital is ensuring the security of every aspect of the business. Microsoft Digital is responsible for company-wide information security and compliance, with a strategic focus on information protection, assessment, awareness, governance, and enterprise business continuity. Microsoft Digital’s charter is also to influence and work alongside engineers across the company and with strategic partners to build and grow their cloud products and services. As customer zero, we deploy these services inside Microsoft and then share best practices with enterprise customers at scale across the globe.  We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to be part of the core software engineering team for Liquid. Liquid is a data-centric cloud service that manages multiple terabytes of data and infuses artificial intelligence to support compliance and risk decision making across the Company, particularly focused on providing the automation and analytics behind many of Microsoft's commitments to security, privacy, and other areas of customer trust. In this role, you’ll work with a range of fun, modern cloud and data-centric technologies -- Azure app services (e.g., web sites), data systems (e.g., Kusto, Azure Data Lake and Cosmos DB) and Machine Learning technologies. You’ll have plenty of mobility across these areas so you can shine where you’re already strong but learn in new areas as well.  As a team we are proud of our approach to work/life balance: we believe that achieving compelling business results does not mean sacrificing our goals as people. If you are excited by the opportunity to work in a critical business area and build long-term value for Microsoft, then we want to hear from you!
