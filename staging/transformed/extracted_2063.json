Collaborate with security architects and researchers across Apple including software, hardware, silicon, server, and product groups on this high-visibility team.   Use a wide range of skills to champion adoption of our elite security technologies including creation of golden unit tests, reference data, or sample libraries to aid integration across team boundaries (e.g. client/server).   Define and document secure architectures, and facilitate creation of certificate hierarchies employed in secure personalization, provisioning, and calibration systems.   Build upon existing security policy management processes and ensure a high degree of integrity for both existing and future policy implementation.   Improve the efficiency of on-boarding new security technologies into Apple platforms through the creation of new processes and procedures for common tasks.   Process, evaluate, and respond to access and policy requests from product, engineering, and operational teams in a friendly, customer service oriented manor.   Reduce development friction imposed by security policy through identification and prototyping of tools and process improvements.   Modernize and streamline existing toolchains for security policy management by developing system requirements and driving the implementation with internal support teams.
