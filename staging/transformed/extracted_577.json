We invented 3rd-party box-free in-person returns (like you now see at Amazon to Kohl’s) and we provide the only end-to-end returns solution for digitally-native and omnichannel retailers that is not only delightful for customers (our lifetime Net Promoter Score is 94 on millions of returns) but also saves money for retailers and is better for the planet.  We are solving the #1 pain point in e-commerce and having a lot of fun doing it. Join our passionate, fast-growing team and help us transform the landscape of online shopping. Diversity of Experience and Perspective  At Happy Returns, we’re looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity.

We welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren’t afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.",
