Do you relish the opportunity to dive headfirst into vast, high-impact projects and make foundational contributions across analytics, strategy and operations? If so, this role is for you!  As a Senior Data Scientist on our Customer Support Services team, you will partner closely with key business leads, focus on some of the most exciting challenges Atlassian faces. We analyze data from a variety of sources, such as support tickets, product analytics and application logs, to understand the friction our customers are facing and work with our development teams to enhance our applications.  We challenge each other constantly to improve our work and ask hard questions. We're direct, focused, and strive for perfection, but there's laughter in every meeting because we thoroughly enjoy the work we do and the impact it has. We're constantly growing, learning, adapting, and trying new things. Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning & growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more. Creating software that empowers everyone from small startups to the who’s who of tech is why we’re here. We build tools like Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello to help teams across the world become more nimble, creative, and aligned—collaboration is the heart of every product we dream of at Atlassian. From Amsterdam and Austin, to Sydney and San Francisco, we’re looking for people who want to write the future and who believe that we can accomplish so much more together than apart. At Atlassian, we’re committed to an environment where everyone has the autonomy and freedom to thrive, as well as the support of like-minded colleagues who are motivated by a common goal to: Unleash the potential of every team . We believe that the unique contributions of all Atlassians is the driver of our success. To make sure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone's perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, or marital, veteran, or disability status.  All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.  If your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you can rock the role, we’d love to learn more about you.
