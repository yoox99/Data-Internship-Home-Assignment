With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood is lowering barriers, removing fees, and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in. Just as we focus on our customers, we also strive to create an inclusive environment where our employees can thrive and do impactful work. Robinhood is backed by leading investors that include DST Global, Index Ventures, NEA, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, and Sequoia.  Check out life at Robinhood on The Muse! We’re a rapidly growing team serving a highly results-oriented engineering organization. The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team provides a specialization within engineering focused on designing, engineering, evolving, and safely making changes to large-scale distributed systems; these systems are often composed of disparate components which are each individually complex. In the process of that work, they are also responsible for analyzing, repairing, and preventing unexpected issues that emerge from such systems. We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.Robinhood promotes diversity and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.
