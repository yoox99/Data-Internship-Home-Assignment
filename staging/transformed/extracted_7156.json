    "description": "Robinhood was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood is lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in. Just as we focus on our customers, we also strive to create an inclusive environment where our employees can thrive and do impactful work. Check out life at Robinhood on The Muse! Research has been central to our product development and business strategy since the very beginning - and our team continues to grow, along with our user base and product. Working on the research team at Robinhood, you’ll help us systematically understand how people interact with financial products and how they think and feel about money. We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all.
