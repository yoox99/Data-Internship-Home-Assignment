We get to do great user experience work here and believe in a collaborative working style where researchers, designers, product managers, and engineers work together to experiment and riff off each other’s curiosity. Our rapidly growing global team of diverse and talented researchers and designers are made up of fun and caring people who bring unique skill sets, perspectives, and personalities to a product team that respects autonomy and advocates for our customers.  We believe great products are built by deeply understanding our customers — who they are, what motivates them, why they behave the way they do, and what they think of our brand, our products, our services, and the overall market. Shutterstock is on an amazing journey to pursue our vision beyond that of stock photography, video, and audio. We are building an intelligent, creative platform where our customers ideate, publish, distribute and measure the performance of their creative supported by bleeding edge technology and AI capabilities.  We need help dreaming up and building out some really cool products by understanding who our customers are, how they use those products, how to make the experience valuable, and win their hearts and minds. We are looking for a researcher who is strong in evaluative research methods, as well as has some generative research experience. A person who can help us understand if our ideas, concepts, and products in the market are not only usable but also are providing value to our customers. Someone who can also serve as the voice of the customer, act as a customer experience advocate, and help drive understanding and empathy for our customers.  The day to day We are one team collectively focused on creating an unrivaled experience for our Customers and Contributors. Our principles represent the mindset of the employee who will thrive at Shutterstock.
