    "description": "Meds need an upgrade. Two-thirds of Americans are taking Rx meds on a regular basis and pharmacists are the best source of support, but people don't have a good way to partner with them. Meet Walrus, everyone's personal pharmacist.  Walrus sells into employer and medicare health plans, giving everyone on the plan a personal pharmacist to help them make informed decisions about their meds. Our pharmacists navigate members through all the complexities of managing their conditions and they work with physicians to keep the whole care team in sync. Through Walrus, members manage their health, save money and improve their quality-of-life. We are looking for a well rounded Senior Data Scientist to build and maintain the data pipeline, processing, and analysis that ultimately power our pharmacist, member, and administrative applications. This is a high impact role sitting at the intersection of business operations, product, and engineering— solving some of our most difficult challenges. As one of the earliest hires on our data team, you’ll play an integral part in shaping the process, architecture, and roadmap of work to come.",
