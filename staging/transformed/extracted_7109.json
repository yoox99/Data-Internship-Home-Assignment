    "description": "It all started with an idea at Square in 2013. Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic app, bringing a better way to send, spend, invest, and save to our millions of monthly active users. We want to make the world’s relationship with money more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. This is our mission, and it’s why working at Cash App means so much more than a job.  Today, Cash App has thousands of employees working globally across office and remote locations, with a culture geared toward creativity, collaboration and impact. We’ve been a distributed team since day one, and we’ve got offices and remote teammates across the globe. Our offices are great, but many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Cash App operates. No matter the location, we tailor our experience to ensure our employees are creative, productive, and happy.

The Bank Rails team is a new team created to take on all of the ways we move money in and out of banks globally. In addition to taking over operation of the existing ACH infrastructure, which moves hundreds of millions of dollars every week, we’ll be building out platform support for mechanisms such as wire transfers, SEPA, and locale-specific real-time payment rails (Faster Payments, RTP), remote check deposit, and paper money deposit. The Treasury team is responsible for ledgering of all our customers' stored value transactions and the settlement of funds with our external banking partners. The Treasury team works closely with product teams to ensure funds flows of new and existing products are supported. Additionally, the team is responsible for scaling these capabilities to support the growth of global expansion.
