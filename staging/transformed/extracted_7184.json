    "description": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) combines the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure to deliver high-performance, high availability, and cost-effective infrastructure services. Multiple compute options provide the flexibility to run the most demanding workloads, as well as less compute-intensive applications, in a secure and highly available cloud environment. Customers can self-service provision virtual machines right alongside bare metal servers and clusters on the same virtual cloud networks, through a unified web console, APIs, CLI, or via industry-standard tools such as Terraform and Chef. OCI's approach gives the customer choices for storage us industry-leading local NVME storage or elastic network block storage.
